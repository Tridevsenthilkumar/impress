‚ù§Ô∏è Drag Papers - Interactive Love Notes üíå
Overview
This Drag Papers project is a creative, interactive web application where users can move, drag, and rotate virtual pieces of paper to reveal hidden messages and images layered beneath. It brings a charming, analog feel to digital communication.

Motivation
The project is inspired by the simple, personal joy of reading a handwritten note, where you physically interact with layers of paper to uncover a complete message or set of memories.

Credits
The core concept and interactive drag logic are based on standard HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript techniques.

Features
Realistic Interaction: Drag papers with the primary mouse button (or single touch) and rotate them with the secondary mouse button (right-click) or a two-finger gesture on mobile.

Layering Effect: Papers stack with dynamic z-index, ensuring the selected paper always moves to the top.

Thematic Design: Uses special background textures for the body and papers to mimic real paper.

Customizable Content: Easily swap out images and text for personalized messages.

Mobile Support: Includes dedicated JavaScript logic (mobile.js) for smooth performance on touch devices.
